# 🚗 No-Ops AI Agent for Road Accident Management

An AI-powered insurance automation agent that simulates real-time accident analysis using computer vision, quantum-like logic simulation, and PDF reporting. Built with Gradio for rapid prototyping and UI interaction.

---

## 💡 Features

- 🧠 **Quantum Simulation** of transaction authenticity
- 🚘 **Vehicle Number Extraction** (Dummy for simulation)
- 🔧 **Damage Severity Detection**
- 🩺 **Injury Level Detection**
- 📄 **Automated PDF Report Generation**
- 🚑 **Service Notifications** (Ambulance, Tow Vehicle, IRDA)
- 🖥️ **Gradio UI** for real-time simulation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Gradio (UI)
- OpenCV (Computer Vision)
- NumPy (Simulation Logic)
- FPDF (PDF Report Generation)

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/PSivaMallikarjun/no-ops-ai-agent](https://github.com/PSivaMallikarjun/Insure_OnSpot_AI_Agent).git
   cd Insure_OnSpot_AI_Agent
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Click on **"Start Agent Simulation"** in the UI.
2. The agent processes 3 synthetic image frames as mock accident scenes.
3. For each frame:
   - Simulated vehicle number is extracted.
   - Randomized damage severity and injury level are generated.
   - A quantum evaluation determines fraud or approval status.
   - A PDF report is created and saved.
   - Service notifications (hospital, tow, IRDA) are printed to the console.
4. All summaries are shown in the UI textbox.

---

## 📂 Output

- A detailed PDF file like `Claim_Report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pdf` for each frame
- Console logs for agent actions
- Summarized reports in Gradio Textbox UI

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Real OCR for vehicle number using `pytesseract`
- Real image upload and webcam stream input
- Integration with live accident datasets
- Backend integration with real IRDA/FIR services
